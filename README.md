This project aims to investigate and determine the attention span of people using a vr headset and can also be used to determine neurological disorders like dislexia and autism.

## Project Overview

This project investigates how Virtual Reality (VR) gaming influences cognitive processes by analyzing the P300 brain wave, a marker associated with attention, memory, and decision-making. By examining variations in the P300 signals during VR gameplay, we aim to understand the cognitive impact and explore the potential of neurofeedback applications to enhance cognitive performance in virtual environments.

## Objective

To analyze the amplitude and latency of P300 brain waves during VR gaming sessions to understand the influence on cognitive engagement, attention, memory, and decision-making processes.

## Methodology

1. **VR Game Development**: A big ball small ball game was designed to target cognitive processes, ensuring immersive experiences and cognitive challenges. This game is suitable for all the age gropus including young and old participants. This game is efficient in trigerring the p300 signals. First the headband is used for the baseline cognitive assessment. After this the partipants play the game and their p300 signals amplitude and latency are used to calculate their attention span.
2. **Participant Recruitment**: Participants were selected based on age, gender, and gaming experience. Informed consent was obtained.
3. **Baseline Assessments**: Cognitive assessments were administered before VR sessions using validated tools.
4. **Data Collection**: VR sessions were conducted in a controlled environment using high-density EEG to collect data on P300 brainwave activity. The data is collected over different channels of the headband which contains alpha, beta ,gamma  and delta signals. 
5. **Data Analysis**: EEG  data were preprocessed, followed by machine learning analysis to predict cognitive states. 
6. **Results Interpretation**: The participants are classified as focused , drowsy and unfocused state. 

## Results

- **Attention Span**: Gamers exhibited shorter attention spans and faster transitions between focused, unfocused, and drowsy states.
- **Cognitive Risks**: The gaming group showed an increased risk of conditions such as ADHD and dyslexia.
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic regression was employed to classify and predict cognitive state transitions, providing statistical evidence of the observed differences.
- This project even demonstrated the potential to detect neurological disorders like dislexia and autism. This could be detected if the alpha and beta signals are of the range 8 to 12uV.
